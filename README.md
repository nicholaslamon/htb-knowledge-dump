# htb-knowledge-dump
A knowledge bank for all of the things I learn doing HTB/TryHackMe. The purpose of this repo is to document my time spent on HTB and learning some Red Team/PenTesting strategies as my focus in school is on network operations and security. 

The majority of the files in this repo are going to be text documents that outline my experiences with different machines, and helpful commands for using different programs and services.
